# Image-Classification

**CIFAR-10 Image Classifier**
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a popular dataset of 60,000 small images across 10 categories, such as airplanes, cars, birds, and cats. If you're new to Machine Learning or Neural Networks, this project is a great way to understand how machines "see" and classify images.


**What Does This Project Do?**
Trains a CNN model to recognize images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Evaluates the model's performance on unseen data.
Predicts the category of new images, like whether an image is a "dog" or a "truck."
Provides a simple web app where you can upload an image for prediction.


**How to Run the Project**
**Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**

Install Python (version 3.8 or newer).
Install the required libraries:
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
If you want to run the web app, install Streamlit:
pip install streamlit

**Step 2: Run the Code**
**Option 1: Use Google Colab (Recommended for Beginners)**
Open Google Colab.
Copy and paste the code into a new notebook.
Run the code blocks step-by-step.

**Option 2: Run Locally**
Clone this repository:
git clone <repository-link>
cd cifar10-image-classifier
Open the code in an IDE like PyCharm or VS Code.
Run the file cifar10_classifier.py.

**Step 3: Test the Model**
Once trained, the model will:
Predict the category of test images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Show the model's accuracy (usually around 75–80%).

**What is CIFAR-10?**
CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 images in 10 categories:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
Each image is 32x32 pixels and labeled with its category.

Example:

A picture of a cat is labeled as "Cat."
A picture of a truck is labeled as "Truck."

**Step 4: Try the Web App**
Save your trained model as cifar10_classifier.h5.
Run the web app:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Upload an image (32x32 resolution recommended) for prediction. The app will tell you what it sees in the image.


**What Will You See?**
**1. Displays Example Images**
The project shows 10 images from the CIFAR-10 dataset with their labels.
Example: A picture of a bird labeled as "Bird."


**2. Trains the Model**
The CNN learns to classify images into one of 10 categories.
It shows the training and test accuracy.


**3. Makes Predictions**
The model predicts the category of a test image.
Example:
Input: A picture of a truck.
Output: "Predicted: Truck."


**4. Visualizes Results**
Graphs show how accuracy and loss improved during training.

**Examples of Predictions**
Image	Predicted Label
        Airplane
        Dog
        Truck

**Beginner-Friendly Concepts**

**What is a CNN?**
CNNs are special types of neural networks designed to work with images. They detect patterns like edges, shapes, and colors to classify images.
Why Normalize Images?

Normalizing (scaling pixel values to 0-1) helps the model learn faster and better.
What is One-Hot Encoding?

Labels like "Cat" or "Dog" are converted to a format the model understands, e.g., [0, 1, 0, 0, ...] for "Dog."


**Future Ideas for Improvement**
Add data augmentation (e.g., flipping, rotating images) to make the model more robust.
Use pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG16 for better accuracy.
Deploy the project on a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.


**About the Developer**
This project was developed by Sachin Yadav as a beginner-friendly introduction to image classification with neural networks. If you’re a beginner, this project will help you understand the basics of machine learning with practical hands-on experience.
